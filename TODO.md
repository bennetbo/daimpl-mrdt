scala:
- [ ] How can we speed up the merge function of sets? Use red black trees?
- [ ] Proper docs

rust:
- [ ] Implement diffing for the quark store
  - [ ] Measure storage impact (no-diff, gzip, diff, gzip+diff)
- [ ] Optimize the mrdt implementation (lots of low hanging fruit, lot's of clones all over the place)
- [ ] Proper docs
